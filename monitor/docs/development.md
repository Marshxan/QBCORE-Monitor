# txAdmin Development
If you are interested in development of txAdmin, this short guide will help setup your environment. 
Before starting, please make sure you are familiar with the basics of NodeJS & ecosystem.
> **Note:** This guide does not cover translations, [which are very easy to do!](./translation.md)  


## Requirements
- Windows, as the `main-builder.js` is doesn't yet work for other OSs;
- NodeJS v16.x to match the one in FXServer;
- FXServer;


## Project Structure
- `core`: Node Backend & Components. This part is transpiled by `tsc` and then bundled with `esbuild`;
- `resource`: The in-game resource that runs under the `monitor` name. These files will be synchronized with the deploy path when running the `dev:main` npm script;
- `menu`: React source code for txAdmin's NUI Menu. It is transpiled & built using Vite;
- `web`: SSR templates & static assets used for the txAdmin's web panel. Right now this uses EJS as templating engine, which should change soon to also be React with Vite;
- `scripts`: The scripts used for development only.


## Preparing the environment
1. First, clone the txAdmin repository;
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin
```
2. Install dependencies & prepare commit hook;
```sh
npm install
npm run prepare
```
3. Edit `.deploy.config.js > fxserverPath` to the path of your `FXServer.exe` file.


## Development Workflows

### Core/Resource
This workflow is controlled by `main-builder.js`, which is responsible for:
- Watching and copying static files (resource, docs, license, entry file, etc) to the deploy path;
- Watching and re-transpiling the core files, and then bundling and deploying it;
- Run FXServer (in the same terminal), and restarting it when the core is modified (like `nodemon`, but fancy).

Although the code is somewhat complex, to run it simply:
```sh
npm run dev:main
```

### NUI Menu
To run Vite on browser dev mode:
```sh
npm run dev:menu:browser
```

To run Vite on game dev mode:
```sh
npm run dev:menu:browser
```
Keep in mind that for every change you will need to restart the `monitor` resource, and unless you started the server with `+setr txAdmin-menuDebug true` txAdmin will detect that as a crash and restart your server.


### Building/Publishing
First make sure the files are linted properly and that the typecheck is successful, and then run the build command. The output will be on the `dist/` folder.
```sh
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

## Note regarding the Web UI

**âš Warning: Soon we will rewrite the entire Web UI in react, so don't put any effort in the Web UI right now.**

**DO NOT** Modify `css/coreui.css`. Either do a patch in the `custom.css` or modify the SCSS variables.  
This doc is a reference if you are trying to re-build the `css/coreui.css` from the SCSS source.  
The only thing I changed from CoreUI was the `aside-menu` size from 200px to 300px in `scss/_variables.scss : $aside-menu-width`.  
You can find the other variable names in `node_modules/@coreui/coreui/scss/coreui`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-bootstrap-admin-template.git coreui
cd coreui
npm i

# If you want to make sure you used the same version of CoreUI
git checkout 0cb1d81a8471ff4b6eb80c41b45c61a8e2ab3ef6

# Edit your stuff and then to compile:
npx node-sass --output-style expanded --source-map true --source-map-contents true --precision 6 src/scss/style.scss src/css/style.css
```

Then copy the `src/css/style.css` to txAdmin's folder.
